## Overview

### Links

-   Card URL: [Vercel URl](https://testimonials-grid-section-nu-mocha.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter:400,700,800&display=swap");
```
Here I decided to add a google font using css. I also found out about display=swap feature. The browser will initially show a fallback font, then once the Google Font has downloaded it will swap the fonts.

```html
<hr class="new__hr" />
```
Here I used hr for the first time to make a horizontal line. 

```css
.header {
	position: sticky;
	top: 0;
}

.nav {
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	position: fixed;
}
```
This article really helped me understand the position feature.
### Continued development

In my future projects I really want to have more pracice with:
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
